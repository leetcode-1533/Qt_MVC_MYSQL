#Qt&C++ 
**Hi**, This is yingjie.

And this is my first Qt based middle scale program.

I spent approximately 20 hours on that.

The most time costing part of this whole project is the SQL part.For I knew nothing about Mysql at first.

 And I also don't have that Amount of time to learn that.
The only way that I found this by numerous testing and modify the starndard code made by `phpmyadmin`.

##How to use that
###First
**Well** you have to install a `mysql` driver on your Pc first.
###Second
Then you can modify the fill in the class constructor called `mysel_establish`. The the connection configure is in that file.
###Database part
If you just feel tired and lazy. You can just create a table call `test` in your database. Then you can run the `initialize` funtion located at the class called `mysql_establish`. And the database is then eastablish.
The final stage is to add an user and its password as well. It is set by your. And the standard one is in the `UI` file.

## My gaining
1. The first `Model-View` architecture Program.
2. The first `GIT` based programming managing test.
3. The first middle scale program.
4. The first `database` based system.
5. The first `Markdown` file :)

## My future plan

After this project.I think my ability in Object-oriented programming is greatly enhanced. And I think it is time for to go back and study the hardware part.

My start point plan is to start the `porting communication program`. It is still a C++ program but what it deals is the port communication. The class is prepared, and what I need to do is to add it to the database and present it in the form of GUI. The rest is easy for me except the port system.
